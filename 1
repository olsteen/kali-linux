Using Tow-Boot

Tow-Boot is an opinionated distribution of the U-Boot bootloader. It includes an USB Mass Storage Mode, which exposes the flash drive(s) to a computer connected to the phone via USB-C. The Tow-Boot bootloader has to be installed if it is not pre-installed already. For instructions see the following links:

    PinePhone Pro: https://tow-boot.org/devices/pine64-pinephonePro.html

If Tow-Boot is installed the phone can be started into USB Mass Storage Mode by holding the volume up key on startup.

The steps of flashing an operating system to the phone after booting Tow-Boot's USB Mass Storage Mode and connecting the phone to a computer is identical to that of any other storage medium - e.g. a microSD card. You can use the dd command or a utility such as Etcher or Gnome Disks from the computer the phone is connected to.
